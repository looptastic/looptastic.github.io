<h1>LOOPTASTIC ALLOWS USERS TO CHECK BIORHYTHYMS ON THEIR MOBILE DEVICE</h1><br>
<h2>Mobile App Measures 4 Types of Biorhythm Cycles</h2><br>

<img src="http://looptastic.com/looptastic2.gif" align=right>According to scientific theory, a person's life is influenced by what are termed rhythmic biological cycles that affect their ability in various domains - mental, physical and emotional activity. What if a person could have their biorhythms with them at all times, as close as their mobile device?  The power to act and make decisions when they were under peak influence could make one more productive.  Acting on that premise, Looptastic the app has been created and will soon be released for both the Google Android and Apple iOS platforms.<br><br>

Mark Twain said that “by the Law of Periodical Repetition, everything which has happened once must happen again and again -- and not capriciously, but at regular periods, and each thing in its own period, not another's, and each obeying its own law.”<br><br>

When it comes to biorhythms, each cycle has a unique period. The interaction of these cycles varies. For instance, the physical cycle lasts 23 days while the intellectual lasts 33 days.  All cycles start at a zero value.  All cycles begin on the day of one's birth in the positive part of the cycle.  At the half way point through the cycle the waves again cross zero and move into the negative part of the cycle like a wave pattern.<br><br>

The Looptastic app has an attractive UI which will allow users to customize background colors, allow users to share the screenshot with their friends and the world through twitter, Facebook, and other social media.  Users have the ability to setup a daily alarm which will help inform them about the day's rhythms.  All that's required is the user's birth date.  Users will be able to view typical curves about mood such as physical, emotional and intellectual as well as  new ones developed by the app team such as intuition, spiritual, aesthetic, and awareness.

<h1>LOVE INDEX PREDICTION FOR VALENTINE’S DAY </h1>
<h1>New biorhythm tracker, Looptastic, allows users to check cycles on their mobile devices</h1>

February, 2015, New York, NY –– According to scientific theory, a person's life is influenced by what are termed rhythmic biological cycles that affect their ability in various domains - mental, physical and emotional activity. What if a person could have their biorhythms with them at all times, as close as their mobile device?  The power to act and make decisions when they were under peak influence could make one more productive.  <br><br>

Mark Twain said that “by the Law of Periodical Repetition, everything which has happened once must happen again and again -- and not capriciously, but at regular periods, and each thing in its own period, not another's, and each obeying its own law.”<br><br>

Acting on that premise, Looptastic is available just in time for Valentine’s Day, measuring the personal love index which can help to decide exactly how to spend the day with a special someone. The app instantly tracks emotional cycles in order to help to identify partners who are in the right kind of mood.<br><br>

When it comes to biorhythms, each cycle has a unique period. The interaction of these cycles varies. For instance, the physical cycle lasts 23 days while the intellectual lasts 33 days.  All cycles start at a zero value.  All cycles begin on the day of one's birth in the positive part of the cycle.  At the half way point through the cycle the waves again cross zero and move into the negative part of the cycle like a wave pattern. With Looptastic, users have never had an easier time measuring their physical, emotional, intellectual, intuition, spiritual, and aesthetic cycles.<br><br>

The Looptastic app has an attractive UI which will allow users to customize background colors.

	Free Biorhythms
      Biorhythm charts illustrate the principle that we are influenced by physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles. Many people report that they can improve the quality of their lives by monitoring the highs and lows of these cycles and acting accordingly. For example, you might try to schedule important exams during your intellectual highs, avoid talking to your significant other during your emotional lows, or arranging the lineup of your game team around their physical highs.
